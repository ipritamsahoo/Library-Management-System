# Library Management System
<br>
This project is a Library Management System built using C that allows an admin to manage a library of books and users. The system provides functionality for adding, viewing, editing, issuing, and returning books, as well as managing users.
<br>
The data is stored in files (books.txt and users.txt), and the system dynamically allocates memory for books and users, expanding its capacity when necessary.
